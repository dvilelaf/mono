description: Use when smoke-testing or writing regression coverage for the jinn operator dashboard SPA — touching routing, layout, bootstrap/status data flow, or operator-visible surfaces, or reproducing a paper cut a user reported in the running-mode dashboard. Covers both manual chrome-devtools MCP walks against a live daemon and Playwright E2E tests with mocked daemon API.

# Testing the Jinn App

The jinn app is the operator dashboard SPA at `client/src/dashboard/spa/`, served by the jinn daemon's HTTP API. Two complementary recipes drive it end-to-end — both share the same daemon-spawn pattern; they differ in whether the API is real or mocked.

1. **Manual smoke** via `chrome-devtools` MCP against a live daemon — for spotting UX/layout paper cuts during development.
2. **Automated E2E** via Playwright with route-mocked daemon API — for regression coverage in `client/test/dashboard/`.

## When to use

- After SPA changes that touch routing, layout, bootstrap/status data flow, or shared shell components
- Before opening a PR that changes operator-visible surfaces
- Reproducing a reported paper cut (follow the user's path)
- Adding regression coverage for a new operator workflow

## Daemon spawn (shared by both recipes)

All commands assume cwd = `jinn-mono/cargo/client`.

1. Build: `yarn build` — produces `dist/bin/jinn.js` and the SPA bundle in `dist/dashboard/`. **Re-run after every SPA source edit** — the daemon serves the bundled SPA from disk.
2. Spawn: `node dist/bin/jinn.js run --no-ui`. **Against the operator's real `~/.jinn`, that's the whole command** — the daemon auto-reads `~/.jinn-client/keystore-password` (written at first bootstrap) when `JINN_PASSWORD` is unset. Do NOT ask the operator for a password.

   Env vars only matter when you're deviating from the default setup:
   - `HOME=<tmpdir>` — only set for a *fresh, clean-state* spawn (e.g. E2E test). Omit to attach to the bootstrapped fleet at `~/.jinn` (Base Sepolia master `0xE64bAf0073a71b0Cb2C0558bB16f24b45E1FB5CF`, agent #5474, safe `0x0e767E28C6889CcD0DfB88E631a3702D56Ce24FC`).
   - `JINN_PASSWORD=<password>` — only set when HOME is a fresh tmpdir (no `~/.jinn-client/keystore-password` to auto-read), or to override the on-disk password.
   - `JINN_API_PORT=<port>` — defaults to 7332; override only if 7332 is taken.
   - `BASE_RPC_URL=<rpc>` — only set for fresh-bootstrap setup-mode spawns; existing fleets read it from stored config.
   - `JINN_NETWORK=testnet`, `JINN_DISABLE_TESTNET_FAUCET=1` — only for E2E tests.
3. Capture the handshake URL from stdout/stderr — regex `UI handshake URL:\s+(\S+)`. The token in the URL is one-time per spawn; capture fresh after each restart.
4. Wait for `/v1/bootstrap` to return 200 or 401 before navigating — otherwise the SPA crashes on null data. Poll loop with 250ms backoff is sufficient (see `spa-config.e2e.test.ts`).

## Manual smoke (chrome-devtools MCP)

**Tool prerequisite:** requires `chrome_devtools__navigate_page` (and `__take_screenshot`). Verify with `ToolSearch query="chrome devtools navigate"` first — if the schemas don't surface, this MCP isn't loaded in the session and you cannot do a manual walk. Fall back to the Playwright E2E path below; it covers the same routes/assertions without a browser tool.

1. Run `Bash` with `run_in_background: true` to start the daemon; read background output to capture handshake URL.
2. `chrome_devtools__navigate_page` to the handshake URL.
3. Walk surfaces and screenshot each:
   - **Overview** (`/overview`) — HeroStats (eyebrows `tasks delivered`, `jinn earned`), NetworkCard, OperatorCard, IdentityCard, RecentActivity, QuickActions, AdvancedDetails
   - **Configuration** (`/configuration`) — Network / Security sections; deep-link via hash (`#network`, `#security`). SolverNet selection no longer lives here — it moved to the Operator join flow (see below).
   - **Launcher** (`/launcher`) — owned-SolverNets list rendered from `solvernets.listLaunched`; primary `Create SolverNet` CTA; empty-state copy ("No SolverNets created yet…") when no records exist; each row links to `/launcher/launched/:solverNetId`.
   - **Launcher · Create** (`/launcher/create`) — 5-step Create wizard (Define → Review Contract → Configure Generator → Configure Pricing → Review and Launch). Step is local state, route stays `/launcher/create`. Drafts persist server-side via `solvernets.createDraft / updateDraft`; the Launch action drives the forward-only state machine (`pinning → recording → broadcasting → confirming → spawning → launched`) — see `spec/2026-05-05-solvernet-creation-and-launch.md` §10.
   - **Launcher · Launched** (`/launcher/launched/:solverNetId`) — post-launch dashboard for an owned record. Status badge (launched / paused / retired), generator status, posted-tasks list, spend / runway, Pause/Resume controls, generator-config form (cadence / allowlist / blocklist hot-apply via `solvernets.updateGeneratorConfig`), Danger Zone retire with typed-name confirmation.
   - **Operator · Join** (`/operator/join/:cid`) — operator participation flow keyed by `manifestCid`. Resolves the manifest from registry, surfaces `openRoles`, runs readiness checks (credentials, harness compatibility), writes a `joinedSolverNets[<manifestCid>]` config entry (restart-required — the daemon does not hot-reload SolverNet config).
   - **Top tab nav** — click links, verify URL updates and active-tab indicator follows
4. Stop daemon: `kill $(lsof -ti :PORT)` or send SIGTERM via the background shell handle.

### Things to watch for (regressions caught this way)

- **Layout overflow**: page should not scroll past viewport. AppShell is viewport-locked (`height: 100vh; overflow: hidden`); xterm scrollback in the agent rail will blow document height past 800,000 px if the lock is missing.
- **Empty controls when stored config is partial-shape**: per-field `??` merge is the rule — whole-object fallback (`stored ?? defaults`) leaks `undefined` fields through. Applies wherever stored config is merged into a typed shape (operator `joinedSolverNets[<cid>]`, generator-config form, etc.).
- **Restart banner persistence**: after saving any config that returns `restartRequired: true` (e.g. `operator.join`), the banner must remain visible across tab navigation.
- **Stale daemon on port**: if spawn fails, `lsof -i :PORT` to find the holder, `kill -9` it, retry.
- **Active tab indicator drift**: sky underline should track URL changes — broken when `useLocation` is forgotten.
- **Launch state-machine recovery**: a daemon restarted mid-launch must resume from the last completed phase. After interrupting the launch, restart the daemon and confirm the SPA shows the in-flight `launchProgress` record advancing through `pinning → recording → broadcasting → confirming → spawning → launched` rather than rolling back to draft. The on-disk record is the recovery checkpoint (per §10 of the spec); each phase is idempotent.
- **Registry catalog rendering**: `/operator/join/...` and the launched-list pull from the global subgraph-backed registry. Verify both states: empty (`No launched SolverNets available.` copy when the subgraph returns zero `solvernet-manifest:*` events) and populated (each summary shows name, launcher agentId, status badge, openRoles, prices). A `refresh=1` query param forces a re-pull.
- **Lifecycle transitions**: pause/resume should round-trip without page reload — the launched dashboard polls `solvernets.get` and re-renders the status badge. Retire is destructive: typed-name confirmation must match the SolverNet name exactly before the `[Retire]` button enables; once retired, the dashboard shifts to a read-only terminal state with no resume affordance.
- **Manifest-cid attribution**: claim eligibility is filtered by entries in `joinedSolverNets[<manifestCid>]`. A daemon with no joined SolverNets must not claim *any* tasks — including tasks whose `solverNetManifestCid` matches a SolverNet the operator has not joined. Verify by posting tasks under launcher A's manifest while the operator has joined only launcher B's manifest; the engine-watcher should ignore them.
- **Generator hot-apply (vs. predecessor P0 bug)**: editing cadence / allowlist / blocklist on the launched dashboard must take effect within one generator tick. The PATCH writes both the on-disk record *and* an in-memory mirror inside the running generator's closure — restart should not be required. (This was `jinn-mono-p1t4.2` in the predecessor Launcher mode and is regression-tested in the launcher e2e.)

## Automated E2E (Playwright)

Live template: `client/test/dashboard/spa-config.e2e.test.ts`. The pattern:

1. `test.beforeAll` — spawn daemon (same recipe), poll `/v1/bootstrap` until reachable.
2. `mockDaemonApi(page)` — `page.route(...)` intercepts every endpoint the page touches. The current set, drawn from `client/src/dashboard/spa/src/api/client.ts` (`api.solvernets.*` and `api.operator.*`):
   - `/v1/bootstrap` → running-mode payload (`mode: 'running'`, fleet, chain, joinedSolverNets)
   - `/v1/status` → status snapshot
   - `/auth/handshake**` → suppress redirect, return `{"ok":true}`
   - **Drafts (Launcher · Create)** — `solvernets.listDrafts`, `getDraft`, `createDraft`, `updateDraft`, `deleteDraft` against `/v1/solvernets/drafts[/:id]`
   - **Launch + lifecycle** — `solvernets.launch` against `/v1/solvernets/drafts/:id/launch`; `solvernets.transitionLifecycle` against `/v1/solvernets/launched/:solverNetId/lifecycle` (PATCH `{ target: 'launched' | 'paused' | 'retired' }`); `solvernets.updateGeneratorConfig` against `/v1/solvernets/launched/:solverNetId/generator-config` (PATCH partial)
   - **Owned launched records (Launcher pages)** — `solvernets.get`, `solvernets.listLaunched` against `/v1/solvernets/launched[/:solverNetId]`
   - **Global registry (Operator · Join)** — `solvernets.listRegistry`, `solvernets.getManifest` against `/v1/solvernets/registry[/:cid]`
   - **Operator participation** — `operator.join`, `operator.leave` against `/v1/operator/join/:manifestCid` (POST writes `joinedSolverNets[<cid>]` with `restartRequired: true`; DELETE removes it)
   - The predecessor `fetchLauncherStatus`, `fetchLauncherTasks`, and `patchLauncherSolverNet` methods have been removed; do not mock the legacy `/v1/launcher/*` paths.
3. `page.goto(handshakeUrl ?? "http://127.0.0.1:PORT/")`.
4. Drive: `getByRole('link', { name: /configuration/i }).click()`, `getByRole('button', { name: /save changes/i }).click()`, etc. Prefer accessible-role queries over CSS selectors.
5. Assert: `expect(page).toHaveURL(...)`, `expect(page.getByText(/configuration saved/i)).toBeVisible()`.
6. `test.afterAll` — SIGTERM, fall back to SIGKILL after 500ms.

Run a single E2E file: `yarn build && playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts test/dashboard/spa-config.e2e.test.ts` (model after the `e2e:spa` script in `client/package.json`).

## Quick reference

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Spot a UX/layout bug | Manual + chrome-devtools, take screenshots |
| Reproduce a reported issue | Manual + chrome-devtools, follow user's exact path |
| Add regression coverage | Playwright E2E with `page.route` mocks |
| Verify hash deep-links | Navigate to `/configuration#network` etc. |
| Test against real chain state | Reuse a bootstrapped HOME, no mocks |
| Test pure SPA wiring | Fresh HOME + mock all `/v1/*` endpoints |

## Common mistakes

- **Forgetting to rebuild**: `dist/bin/jinn.js` and `dist/dashboard/` don't update on source edits — re-run `yarn build` after each SPA change.
- **Reusing a stale handshake URL**: token is one-time per daemon spawn.
- **Mocking too little**: if a polled endpoint isn't intercepted, the SPA renders empty state — mock everything the page touches, including `/auth/handshake`.
- **Killing the daemon too early**: useQuery polls every 1.5s; the daemon must stay alive for the duration of the walk.
- **Skipping the bootstrap-readiness wait**: navigating before `/v1/bootstrap` returns a real status leads to non-deterministic crashes.
