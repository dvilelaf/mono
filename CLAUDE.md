# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Jinn Network monorepo. Phase 0 is complete (Base mainnet). Phase 1a (JINN token + DAO + distribution on testnet) is deployed and proven on Sepolia/Base Sepolia. Phase 1b (protocol hardening on testnet) is in progress — see `spec/2026-04-06-phase-1a-design.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-06-phase-1a-tokenomics.md`.

Jinn is a training protocol for agentic intents. It defines a loop (Creation → Execution → Evaluation → Knowledge) where intents are published with fees, participants attempt fulfillment, evaluators verify results, and knowledge accumulates to improve future attempts.

## jinn-cli-agents Reference

**Always check `jinn-cli-agents/` when working on OLAS integration, staking, tokenomics, or Phase 1 contracts.** This subtree (from github.com/oaksprout/jinn-gemini) contains a wealth of relevant context:

- `docs/reference/blood-written-rules.md` — Hard-won operational lessons (RPC limits, IPFS, polling, etc.)
- `docs/runbooks/` — Setup, deployment, recovery, troubleshooting guides
- `CLAUDE.md` — System architecture overview for the agent orchestration layer

## Running the Client

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (`corepack enable` once so Yarn matches each package’s `packageManager` field)
- Foundry (`anvil` for local fork, `cast` for funding)
- Claude Code CLI (`claude` in PATH — the daemon spawns it as a subprocess)

### Quick validation (Anvil fork, no real funds)

```bash
cd client
yarn install
yarn typecheck   # should be zero errors
yarn test        # vitest suite, all pass
yarn e2e         # full loop on Anvil fork of Base
```

The e2e script spawns Anvil, bootstraps from scratch, runs create → restore → evaluate, and verifies staking rewards. Needs internet (Base RPC + IPFS).

### Production run

```bash
cd client
JINN_PASSWORD=your-keystore-password yarn start
```

Or with a config file:

```bash
JINN_PASSWORD=secret yarn start -- --config ./my-config.json
```

The daemon will:
1. Run the earning bootstrap (wallet → Safe → service → staking → mech)
2. Pause at `awaiting_funding` if the wallet needs ETH/OLAS — fund and re-run
3. Start the daemon with 3 loops (creator, restorer, delivery-watcher)

### Running against Anvil fork (local dev)

```bash
# Terminal 1: start Anvil
anvil --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --port 8545

# Terminal 2: create config and run
mkdir -p ~/.jinn-client
cat > ~/.jinn-client/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "rpcUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
  "claudeModel": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  "desiredStates": [
    { "id": "test-1", "description": "The service is healthy and responding." }
  ]
}
EOF

JINN_PASSWORD=test yarn start
# Will pause at awaiting_funding — fund via cast, then re-run
```

Funding on Anvil (use pre-funded account):
```bash
# Fund EOA with ETH
cast send <EOA_ADDRESS> --value 0.01ether \
  --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545

# Fund Safe with OLAS (impersonate a whale)
cast rpc anvil_impersonateAccount <OLAS_WHALE> --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
cast send 0x54330d28ca3357F294334BDC454a032e7f353416 \
  "transfer(address,uint256)" <SAFE_ADDRESS> 5000000000000000000000 \
  --from <OLAS_WHALE> --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --unlocked
```

## Architecture

Three layers, top to bottom:

1. **DAO Layer (Ethereum Mainnet)** — JINN ERC-20 token, treasury with epoch emissions, ve-JINN gauge for directing emissions to distribution contracts (Phase 1+)
2. **Distribution Contracts (per-chain)** — Four incentive channels (creation, restoration, outcome, evaluation rewards), distribute JINN to qualifying participants (Phase 1+)
3. **Execution Layer (Base)** — OLAS Mech Marketplace (request/delivery), JinnRouter (loop enforcement + activity tracking), ERC-8004 (knowledge discovery), x402 (payment-gated knowledge access)

### How the daemon works

The daemon runs three concurrent loops:

1. **CreatorLoop** — posts each desired state once via `JinnRouter.createRestorationJob()`
2. **RestorerLoop** — watches marketplace for requests, claims them, spawns Claude CLI to attempt restoration, submits result via `mech.deliverToMarketplace()`
3. **DeliveryWatcherLoop** — watches for deliveries, calls `JinnRouter.claimDelivery()`, then creates evaluation jobs via `JinnRouter.createEvaluationJob()`

Each JinnRouter call increments activity counters for the Safe multisig. The OLAS staking contract reads these counters at checkpoints to determine reward eligibility.

### Earning bootstrap

The `EarningBootstrapper` walks through 11 idempotent steps:
1. wallet — create agent EOA + encrypted keystore
2. safe_predicted — predict Safe address
3. awaiting_funding — gate until EOA has ETH + Safe has OLAS
4. safe_deployed — deploy Safe via factory
5. service_created — register service on-chain
6. service_activated — approve OLAS bond + activate
7. agents_registered — register agent in service
8. service_deployed — deploy service
9. service_staked — stake service in staking contract
10. mech_deployed — deploy mech via marketplace
11. complete

State persists to `~/.jinn-client/earning/earning_state.json`. Safe to interrupt and re-run.

## Key Roles

- **Creator** — defines desired states and funds restoration
- **Restorer** — attempts to make desired states true
- **Evaluator** — independently verifies restoration success

## Phased Rollout

- **Phase 0** (complete): Prove on OLAS ecosystem, single chain (Base), OLAS Mech Marketplace + JinnRouter, optimistic evidence, no JINN token
- **Phase 1a** (complete): Fork OLAS contracts with minimal changes, deploy JINN token + Treasury + distribution on Sepolia/Base Sepolia, multisig governance, testnet iteration
- **Phase 1b** (in progress): Protocol hardening on testnet — anti-farming decay, challenge mechanism, ve-JINN gauge voting, evidence schema, full client integration, extended testnet operation
- **Phase 2**: Mainnet launch — fair-launch JINN, multi-chain (Base, Arbitrum), ZK-requiring distribution contracts
- **Phase 3**: Autonomous — full ve-JINN governance, USDC revenue exceeds JINN emissions
