# Operator runbook — Jinn testnet (Base Sepolia + Hyperliquid testnet)

The honest end-to-end guide for running a Jinn operator daemon on testnet. Target audience: you just `npm install -g`'d the client and want to reach "my daemon is trading" in under 15 minutes.

If you hit a wall, jump to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section — the specific symptoms that trip up new operators are enumerated there.

## What Jinn does

Jinn is a training protocol for agentic intents. Operators run a headless daemon that:

1. **Observes** marketplace requests (desired states posted on-chain, IPFS-backed).
2. **Claims** them via the on-chain ClaimRegistry.
3. **Executes** — spawns Claude Code as a subprocess with per-request MCP tools and delegated signing authority over a trading venue (e.g., Hyperliquid).
4. **Delivers** — packages the result + evidence and submits back to the protocol.
5. **Earns** — activity counters on-chain determine staking rewards at each checkpoint.

Testnet is where you prove the loop works against real (test-) money before mainnet goes live.

## What you're signing up for

- A long-running daemon process (bare, Docker Compose, or your own container).
- Two Ethereum-style addresses: a **master wallet** (holds ETH for gas; owns the protocol service) and a **fleet of per-service agents** (Safe multisig + EOA derived from the master mnemonic).
- For portfolio.v0: a **Hyperliquid master account** (holds USDC for trading) and an approved **API wallet / agent** (signs trades on the master's behalf without fund-withdrawal authority).
- Claude Code CLI authenticated on the machine (bare mode) or volume (Docker).

## Key concept — the agent / master duality

For any trading venue Jinn integrates with, there are two keys:

- **Master** — holds funds. Signs deposits, withdrawals, and authorizations. You keep this offline in production.
- **Agent** (also called "API wallet" on Hyperliquid) — a subordinate key the master has delegated trading authority to. The daemon holds the agent key at runtime. If the agent leaks, the attacker can trade but **cannot withdraw** from the master.

The daemon reads the agent key from `/tmp/jinn-engine-impl-state/claude-mcp-hyperliquid/api-wallet.json` (mode 0o600). It never sees the master key.

## One-command install → running

```bash
npm install -g @jinn-network/client@latest
```

Then:

```bash
# Step 1 — Pick runtime mode + authenticate Claude (one-time, interactive).
jinn auth

# Step 2 — Zero-to-running: auto-password + init → fund (auto via CDP) → bootstrap → run daemon.
#           Use a testnet-dedicated earning directory so mainnet state stays separate.
JINN_EARNING_DIR="$HOME/.jinn-client/earning-testnet" JINN_NETWORK=testnet jinn quickstart
```

Expected output:
- `jinn auth` asks "how do you want to run the Jinn daemon?" Pick `bare` unless you've set up Docker Compose.
- `jinn quickstart` prints: keystore created (auto-password saved to `~/.jinn-client/keystore-password`), master address, CDP drips landing, staking complete, daemon started on port 7331.

If it ran through, you're done. Otherwise, skip to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Advanced / CI: explicit password

If you want to supply your own password instead of using the auto-generated one (recommended for production or scripted environments), set `JINN_PASSWORD` before calling `quickstart`:

```bash
export JINN_PASSWORD='your-secure-password'
JINN_EARNING_DIR="$HOME/.jinn-client/earning-testnet" JINN_NETWORK=testnet jinn quickstart
```

When `JINN_PASSWORD` is set, no password file is written to disk. Use `--password-fd N` for CI pipelines where the password comes from a secret manager.

## What `jinn quickstart` does under the hood

The state machine, one line per step:

1. **Resolve password** — from `JINN_PASSWORD` or a one-time generated file under `~/.jinn-client/keystore-password`.
2. **Init** — create or load the fleet mnemonic; persist the encrypted keystore at `$JINN_EARNING_DIR/master_keystore.json`.
3. **Bootstrap (up to 3 attempts, with internal drip loop)**:
    a. Derive master EOA address.
    b. Check master ETH balance on Base Sepolia.
    c. **Drain CDP faucet** until balance clears the `minEoaGasEth` floor (default 0.005 ETH, ~50 drips). New since Phase 2 UX fix — older versions used only 2 drips per run and required operator loops.
    d. Pre-flight: check stOLAS distributor has enough pool liquidity for staking (surfaces as a `distributor_reachable` warning in `jinn doctor` if low).
    e. Call `distributor.stake()` — creates a Safe multisig + service registry entry + attaches the service to the staking contract. Master pays gas; the distributor pool provides the bond.
    f. Fund the agent EOA from master (0.005 ETH for txs).
    g. Deploy a mech on the marketplace (the on-chain identity your daemon claims requests from).
4. **Daemon launch** — spawns three loops: CreatorLoop (post desired states), RestorerLoop (claim + execute), DeliveryWatcherLoop (claim deliveries + create eval jobs).

After this, `jinn status` returns healthy. `http://127.0.0.1:7331/v1/status` is the JSON API.

## Portfolio.v0 intents

Portfolio.v0 is the first non-trivial intent kind — a 24-hour "grow my HL account by X%, keep drawdown under Y%" directive. The restorer impl is `claude-mcp-hyperliquid`: spawns Claude Code every ~30 min (or on ≥2% mid-move), with HL tools as MCP servers.

### Submitting one

Place JSON at `~/.jinn-client/portfolio-v0-intent.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "portfolio-v0-first-run",
    "description": "Grow HL portfolio 5% in 24h with 10% max drawdown.",
    "window": { "startTs": <NOW_MS>, "endTs": <NOW_MS + 86400000> },
    "spec": {
      "kind": "portfolio.v0",
      "account": {
        "venue": "hyperliquid-testnet",
        "masterAddress": "0x..."
      },
      "target":     { "metric": "equity_return_pct", "minReturnPct": 5.0 },
      "constraint": { "maxDrawdownPct": 10.0 }
    },
    "eligibility": { "minClosedTrades": 20, "minTradedNotionalMultiple": 5.0 }
  }
]
```

Point the daemon at it: `export JINN_DESIRED_STATES="$HOME/.jinn-client/portfolio-v0-intent.json"` then restart.

Constraints:
- `window.endTs - window.startTs === 86_400_000` exactly (Zod-enforced; 24h is non-configurable in v0).
- `masterAddress` must have >0 USDC either on the HL perps side or the spot side (cross-margining handles either).
- `eligibility.minClosedTrades >= 1`, `minTradedNotionalMultiple > 0`.

### Pre-run checklist (HL-side)

Before the daemon claims the intent:

1. Generate an API wallet (agent) keypair off-line (or let the impl auto-provision).
2. In the HL testnet UI → Settings → API Wallets: approve the agent's address.
3. Write the agent's key into `/tmp/jinn-engine-impl-state/claude-mcp-hyperliquid/api-wallet.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "privateKey": "0x...",
      "address": "0x...",
      "approved": true,
      "createdAt": 1700000000000,
      "approvedAt": 1700000000000,
      "masterAddress": "0x..."
    }
    ```
    Mode `0o600`. This file auto-deletes on impl startup if already persisted — regenerate if you see `api_wallet_missing` in `jinn doctor`.

## Monitoring

```bash
# Liveness + fleet roll-up.
jinn status

# Detail per service.
jinn fleet

# Balance map across master + all agents + all Safes.
jinn balance

# Structured event log (one JSON object per line).
jinn logs

# Live tail of daemon lifecycle transitions.
jinn logs --follow

# Dashboard UI
open http://127.0.0.1:7331/

# Direct HTTP — portfolio.v0 specifics.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7331/v1/status | jq .portfolioV0
```

The `portfolioV0` block shows:
- `inFlight` — intents currently being processed.
- `recentVerdicts` — last 10 COMPLETE / FAILED intents with their terminal state.
- `recentSnapshots` — pre/post snapshot artifacts.
- `recentClaudeOutcomes` — per-session telemetry: durations, tool call counts, fill counts. Populated in real time as each Claude subprocess exits, so you can answer "is my Claude trading" before the window closes.

## Risk rails (what the errors mean)

The `hl_open_position` MCP tool rejects invalid requests at the tool level before hitting HL. If Claude emits a tool error, the rail caught something:

| Error code | Meaning | Typical remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `TPSL_REQUIRED` | Open without both `tp` and `sl` | Always set TP + SL; or pass `bypassRiskRails: true` for a genuine scalp (logged). |
| `TP_INVALID` | Take-profit on wrong side of mid | For long, `tp > mid`. For short, `tp < mid`. |
| `SL_INVALID` | Stop-loss on wrong side of mid | For long, `sl < mid`. For short, `sl > mid`. |
| `NOTIONAL_EXCEEDED` | Position > 25% of unified account value | Reduce size or leverage. |
| `LEVERAGE_EXCEEDED` | Leverage > 10× | Hard cap; not tunable. |
| `SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED` | `slippageBps > 50` | Max 50 bps IOC slippage. |
| `TRIGGERS_FAILED` | Parent order filled but TP/SL trigger submit failed | Position is live and bare — `hl_close_position` immediately or retry. |
| `HL_EXCHANGE_ERROR` | Hyperliquid returned an error response | Check `message` for the underlying HL reason. |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Too many write ops in the window | Back off; the rate limit resets per session. |
| `UNKNOWN_COIN` | Asset name not in HL universe | Check `hl_meta` for valid names. |

## Testnet-specific caveats

- **Cross-chain JINN issuance burn-in uses MockMessenger.** On Base Sepolia,
  canonical OP-Stack finality is too slow for active operator burn-in, so the
  testnet distributor should be wired to `MockMessenger` and the daemon should
  run with `JINN_MESSENGER_MODE=mock`. This is not a mainnet security claim:
  MockMessenger mirrors the canonical `claimId` snapshot identity but skips the
  OP finality wait. Canonical Base Sepolia is exercised separately as a
  verifier-only canary by building the storage proof after finality and calling
  `CanonicalOpStackMessenger.verifyClaim` via `eth_call`; do not swap the active
  distributor messenger during burn-in.
- **stOLAS distributor pool is protocol-team-managed.** On mainnet, real stakers deposit JINN/OLAS and the pool grows naturally. On testnet there are no stakers, so the team pre-seeds the pool via a one-time bridge from Sepolia L1. If bootstrap fails with `Overflow(20, 0)` at `distributor.stake()`, the pool is drained — nothing you can do locally. Post in the testnet channel and re-run bootstrap after refill.
- **Evicted services recover through the same operator wallet.** In standard mode, `distributor.stake()` records your master EOA as the service operator. If the service is evicted, rerun `jinn bootstrap` with the same `JINN_EARNING_DIR` and `JINN_PASSWORD`; the client calls `distributor.reStake()` from that master EOA. Per-operator whitelisting is not required.
- **CDP faucet rate limits by address over 24h.** If you burn through your daily quota (rare — the drip loop runs ~50 × 0.0001 ETH in 50 seconds, well under CDP's cap), `jinn bootstrap` falls back to a manual-funding poll. Wait or fund via the portal: <https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet>.
- **One HL master per test run.** If you reuse a master across experiments, expect position interference from leftover bots. Fresh master = clean signal.
- **Claude Code CLI auth is machine-local.** Containers need the OAuth token mounted into a persistent volume (see the Docker Compose section of `client/README.md`).
- **Docker Compose cwd detection is flaky.** If you run from inside the `jinn-mono/client/` git checkout, the daemon misdetects `docker-compose` context. Either run from `$HOME`, or set `JINN_RUNTIME_MODE=bare` explicitly — `jinn auth` persists this choice to your config.

## Troubleshooting

### Bootstrap loops forever (or hits `funding_required` after ~50 drips)

The CDP faucet hit its daily rate limit on your master address. Check:

```bash
jinn fund-requirements --human
```

If the reported balance is ~0.005 ETH and still says funding required, that's a bug — file an issue. Otherwise wait 24h or fund manually at <https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet>.

### `jinn doctor` says `daemon_runtime_ready: false`

The compiled `mcp-tools.js` artifact is missing. The daemon cannot run from source — it must run from `dist/`:

```bash
# From a git checkout:
cd client
yarn build
yarn dev  # = build + run

# From an npm install, reinstall:
npm install -g @jinn-network/client@latest
```

### `jinn doctor` says `distributor_reachable: false` with "testnet staking pool is drained"

The stOLAS pool is empty. This is a **protocol-team action** — operators cannot fix it locally. Report in the testnet status channel and re-run `jinn bootstrap` once the pool is topped up.

### Bootstrap fails with `Overflow(20, 0)` at `distributor.stake()`

Same root cause as above — distributor pool drained.

### Bootstrap says the master EOA is not authorized to `reStake`

The service is evicted, but the current master EOA does not match the operator recorded on-chain for that service. Re-run with the same `JINN_EARNING_DIR` and `JINN_PASSWORD` used when the service was first staked. If the original keys are unavailable, ask the protocol team for owner / managing-agent recovery or start over with a fresh earning directory.

### Claude session exits in ~18 seconds with zero tool calls

Usually means the daemon ran from source instead of `dist/`, and the MCP wrapper couldn't load `mcp-tools.js`. Run `jinn doctor`; the `daemon_runtime_ready` check will confirm.

Less common: the MCP config path was wrong, or Claude auth expired. Check `/tmp/jinn-engine-working/<requestId>/sessions/<sessionId>/transcript.txt` for the actual Claude output.

### HL position auto-closed within seconds of opening

A competing trading bot is active on the same HL master. Generate a fresh master and use it exclusively for this test run.

### `jinn auth` says "Claude is not authenticated"

Run the interactive login it suggests. For bare mode: `claude auth login` in a TTY. For docker-compose: `docker compose run --rm -it --entrypoint claude jinn-daemon auth login`. For container: mount your host's Claude state into the container or set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` explicitly.

### I need to start over from scratch

```bash
rm -rf ~/.jinn-client/earning-testnet
rm -rf /tmp/jinn-engine-working /tmp/jinn-engine-impl-state
jinn quickstart
```

Safe — no on-chain state is lost; `jinn bootstrap` reconciles any existing services against the chain.

## Glossary

- **Master** — the top-level EOA in your fleet. Holds ETH; signs the initial staking tx.
- **Agent** — per-service EOA derived from the master mnemonic. Signs service-specific ops.
- **Safe** — Gnosis Safe multisig owned by one agent. Service identity on-chain.
- **Service** — an entry in the OLAS ServiceRegistry; what gets staked.
- **Mech** — on-chain router that converts marketplace requests into claimable jobs.
- **Intent** — an off-chain desired state published via the Jinn protocol.
- **Restorer** — the role that claims + executes an intent (you).
- **Evaluator** — the role that verifies a delivered restoration (probably also you, via a separate service).
- **stOLAS** — liquid staking of OLAS/JINN. On Phase 1b testnet, stOLAS is the bond-pool mechanism; operators never hold it directly.
- **Portfolio.v0** — first non-trivial intent kind: trade an HL account to meet return/drawdown targets over a 24h window.
