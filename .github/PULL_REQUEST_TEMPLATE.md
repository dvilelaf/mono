## Summary

<!--
Problem (not solution): what's wrong / what gap does this close / what need triggers this?
Use the seven work shapes from docs/engineering/handbook.md:
fix / feat / refactor / spike / chore / docs / test (plus fix(incident) for hotfixes).
The shape goes in the PR title as a Conventional Commits prefix:
  fix: SWE typed payload fallback validation
  feat(uy6v): live verdict-success on Base Sepolia
  refactor: extract Harness selection from buildHarnesses
-->

## Linked bd

<!-- e.g. Closes jinn-mono-XXX -->

## Test plan

<!--
How was this verified? Reference the test discipline for the shape:
- fix: regression test first
- feat: TDD per acceptance criteria
- refactor: TDD + integration tests on migration/contract surfaces
- chore (deps): integration test
- spike: not applicable (output is a finding)
- docs / test: skipped or meta
- fix(incident): defer test; file a follow-up bead for the regression test BEFORE closing the incident
