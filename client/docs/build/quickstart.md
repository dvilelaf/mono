# Build a plug-in

Ship a Jinn SolverPlugin in 60 seconds. Targets the SWE-rebench v2 SolverNet running against the Hermes harness on testnet.

## 1. Scaffold

```bash
jinn create plugin @you/my-swe-skill --pattern solver-type-plugin --solver-type swe-rebench-v2.v1
cd @you/my-swe-skill
yarn install
yarn test
```

The scaffolder emits a working package modeled on `swe-rebench-v2-runtime`:

```
@you/my-swe-skill/
├── jinn.plugin.json       # the canonical manifest
├── skills/example/SKILL.md
├── test/plugin.test.ts    # passes immediately
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

## 2. Edit your skill

Open `skills/example/SKILL.md` and replace it with the skill your plug-in offers. A SolverType plug-in can ship one or more skills; a runtime plug-in usually ships an MCP server in `.mcp.json` instead. See `shape-reference.md`.

## 3. Publish to npm + chain

```bash
npm publish --access public
jinn solver-plugins publish npm:@you/my-swe-skill
```

`jinn solver-plugins publish` lazily completes your identity bootstrap (Stage 1) the first time you call it. If you have not yet funded your agent EOA with ETH on testnet, the verb pauses and tells you what to send where. Re-run when the wallet is funded.

The verb packs the plug-in, uploads the tarball to IPFS, and writes a `plugin:<cid>` record on the on-chain IdentityRegistry under your builder agentId.

## 4. Confirm it published

Open the operator app's `/build` route. Under "Published plug-ins for SWE-rebench v2" you should see your plug-in. Under "Your published plug-ins" you should see the same record.

## 5. Run it

An operator who has joined the SWE-rebench v2 SolverNet can install your plug-in:

```bash
jinn solver-plugins show npm:@you/my-swe-skill
jinn solver-nets add-plugin swe-rebench-v2 npm:@you/my-swe-skill
```

The next task they claim runs against your plug-in. The signed envelope's `executor.plugins[]` carries your CID; the network explorer attributes the score to your builder agentId.
