# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Embedded agent surface hidden by default (issue #326)

- **The embedded Claude agent chat surface no longer renders in the operator
  app by default.** The right-rail agent panel (running mode) and the
  "Ask Claude" panel (onboarding) are hidden. The 2026-05-19 v0.1.6 dogfood
  found the surface isn't robust enough for first-time operators — it is the
  only daemon-side surface that strictly requires Claude auth, and its
  action-authority / plugin-scope shape is still in design (#177 / #178).
- **Feature flag: `JINN_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_AGENT`.** Set
  `JINN_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_AGENT=1` (also accepts `true`) to re-enable the
  surface for development. Default is off. When off, the daemon does not
  mount the `/api/agent/ws` bridge and the SPA renders no agent panel; when
  on, the dev-time path works end-to-end as before.
- **Claude-Code-as-a-solver-harness is unaffected.** Operators can still pick
  Claude Code as their SolverNet harness — that path is independent of the
  embedded chat surface and its WebSocket bridge.

### Operator app

- **Plug-in builder UI surfaces hidden by default (issue #327).** The `/build`
  route and the Build top-tab no longer appear in the operator app. Hitting
  `/build` by direct URL redirects to `/overview`. The plug-in substrate stays
  fully live — `jinn solver-plugins publish` / `revoke`, the Ponder indexer,
  the Discovery API endpoints, and the `client/docs/build/` tree are
  unchanged, so direct-CLI builders following the docs are not blocked. The
  surfaces are gated to keep the operator-app first-run UX focused; they will
  be re-promoted once that UX is solid and plug-in indexing is end-to-end
  populated. Set `JINN_ENABLE_PLUGIN_BUILDER_UI=1` on the daemon to re-enable
  the full builder surface for development and design work — the daemon injects
  the flag into the SPA via `window.__JINN_FEATURES__`.

### SWE-rebench v2 admission

- **Admission semantics bumped from `'2'` → `'3'`.** Operators running the
  public/launched generator MUST re-validate before posting resumes:

  ```bash
  jinn solver-nets validate-pool swe-rebench-v2 --seed-positive --known-bad
  ```

  Expected duration: ~1-2h (one gold-patch eval per seed instance).
  Until re-validation runs, the launched generator posts no new tasks
  (admission required; `jinn doctor` reports the pool as stale).
  Note: the seed pool contains 20 instances from common Python repos; typical
  admission rates are 25-40%, so expect 5-8 scorable entries after re-validation.
  Operators can extend the seed list via PR over time.
- **Required admission mode is now the default for launched generators.**
  Local/dev users running `admissionMode: 'python-floor'` keep today's
  behaviour. `jinn doctor` reports pool freshness and prints the exact
  re-validation command when stale.
- **Verdict-time substrate recheck** catches drift between admission and
  grading. Any mismatch (rowHash, imageDigest, HF outage) skips the verdict
  rather than emitting a misclassified FAIL.

## v0.1.5 — Operator App

_Released 2026-05-13_

# v0.1.5 — "Operator App"
2026-05-13 · Suggested bump: patch (first npm `@latest` cut that ships the app-first operator experience)

## Highlights

- Release plumbing fixed so the cut can actually ship. `npm-publish.yml` now installs `contracts/` before the operator gate, the Docker/GHCR workflow accepts the new `v<semver>` tag format alongside legacy `client-v*`, and the CHANGELOG mirror writes through a PR (no more failed direct push to protected `main`).
- SWE-rebench v2 verdict path is structurally correct end-to-end. The eval loop no longer emits verdicts on non-gradeable evals (uy6v.8), the daemon's `verdictCode` default is `Invalid`, not `Pass` (uy6v.7), evaluator-side gating now surfaces a real verdict so the reputation feedback hook fires (uy6v.10), and the `evaluation:<cid>` MetadataSet is published on verdict delivery (n93o).
- Per-operator disks no longer fill in a couple of weeks. The SWE-rebench v2 eval-image cache is bounded by an in-process LRU (uy6v.11).
- Operator app feedback on issue 188 addressed across overview / launcher / catalog / configuration / shell, with dashboard tests refreshed.
- Daemon execution envelope now carries the executor model (`gbut`), giving downstream consumers the model that produced each Solution / Verdict.
- Discovery API no longer 404s for just-launched manifests when no subgraph is configured (#170) — important for fresh launcher records.

## Recovery context

v0.1.4 published as a GitHub Release at `fa8da678` but the npm-publish workflow failed before publish in `release:operator-gate` because contracts dependencies were not installed in the clean Actions checkout. The fix landed as PR #187 *after* the v0.1.4 tag was created, so the v0.1.4 release commit could not retry publish. v0.1.5 cuts from current `main` (`56e84952`) which includes that fix; `@jinn-network/client@latest` becomes `0.1.5` (replacing the stale `0.1.2`). v0.1.4 remains as a Build Notes Release; no `0.1.4` npm artifact exists.

## v0.1.4 — Shipping Machine

_Released 2026-05-12_

2026-05-12 · Suggested bump: patch (Captain: override to vX.Y+1.0 if an epic closed in this window)

### Highlights
- Operator onboarding: `jinn run` now owns first-run setup, including keystore-password generation and app-driven Claude sign-in for bare-host operators.
- Discovery API and hosted-subgraph removal: the client now follows the on-chain-first path from the merged 280n stack.
- Engineering handbook v1: the shipping-machine SOP, release-note scaffold, cadence correction, and Run-mode chore conventions are now exercised by a real cut.
- SWE-rebench v2 donation prep: package and gate work for donated execution-data consumption is included, with release gates run before publish.

### Operator-facing notes
- A brand-new operator can run `jinn run` with no env var, no setup, and no input; the daemon now generates a local keystore password when needed and opens the app while bootstrap continues.
- Host operators sign in through the app with `Sign in with Claude`; Docker/container modes still surface the appropriate CLI command because the daemon cannot reach the operator's host browser.
- The old `jinn quickstart` verb has been removed; `jinn run` is the supported zero-to-running path.

### Known issues
- The v1 public-testnet milestone (`jinn-mono-uy6v`) is not included in this cut; it remains the next major waypoint, with open P0 work still tracked separately.
- This is a weekly patch Build Notes release, not a v1 graduation or the `jinn-mono-uy6v` milestone.

## 0.1.3

- Added the v0 testnet cross-chain JINN claim loop, including bundled Sepolia/Base Sepolia MVI deployment artifacts, MockMessenger burn-in support, and canonical OP-Stack verifier canary tooling.
- Added Safe v1.3 inner-revert decoding so permanent claim and delivery races stop retrying with generic `GS013` errors.
- Updated bundled Phase 1b deployment defaults for the proxy-deployable V2 activity checker and JINN MVI testnet stack.
- Added release-gate coverage for contract tests, storage-layout drift checks, and Foundry invariant harness compilation.
- Hardened the local operator release gate for the current adapter API, ERC-8004 stubbed subgraph surface, and forked-chain `setAgentWallet` deadlines.
- Switched the docker testnet acceptance gate from legacy health-check intents to the auto-generated `prediction.v0` loop. The gate now requires both restoration and evaluation success per cycle, gates on cycles produced after `runStartAt`, and uses tighter cycle-shaping params (`JINN_PREDICTION_V0_WINDOW_MS=120000`, `JINN_PREDICTION_V0_RESOLVE_GAP_MS=60000`) so a full restoration→delivery→evaluation→claim round-trip lands inside the 20-minute timeout.

## 0.1.2

- Replaced the `mech-client-ts` IPFS upload dependency with the client’s own Autonolas registry upload path, reducing the packed install footprint and removing the deprecated js-IPFS transitive chain from the release artifact.
- Updated the optional Coinbase CDP SDK used for testnet faucet support.
- Added `jinn intents enable --impl <name>` plus `jinn intents reset <kind>` so operators can switch intent implementations without hand-editing config.
- Removed the default legacy health-check desired state; testnet now relies on the deterministic auto-generated `prediction.v0` intent path by default.
- Added graceful legacy Claude skip behavior (`claude_unavailable`) when auth/quota blocks health-check restoration attempts.
- Fixed no-install invocation so `npx @jinn-network/client@<version> <verb>` works directly via a `client` bin alias.
- Added canonical `jinn mcp` command and kept `jinn-mcp` as a deprecation shim.
- Extended package smoke tests to validate both direct `npx` and legacy `npx -p ... jinn ...` execution paths.
- Includes prior validated canary fixes now rolled into stable:
  - PR #21 default Base Sepolia ClaimRegistry
  - PR #22 idempotent replayed `claimDelivery`
  - PR #23 prediction evaluator support for signed engine manifests
