/**
 * In-process respawn helper for operator-triggered daemon restarts.
 *
 * Issue #289 added respawn-instead-of-exit so the operator panel survives a
 * restart click. Issue #561 fixed the follow-on bug: the original respawn
 * spawned the child *before* the parent had released its server sockets, so
 * the child raced into `.listen(7332)` while the parent still held the port
 * and died with EADDRINUSE / exitCode 11. The fix is `preSpawnCleanup` — an
 * async hook the caller uses to close API + OTLP receivers before the child
 * is spawned. With cleanup in place the port is free synchronously and the
 * child binds on first try; without it (older callers, tests) the helper
 * behaves as before.
 *
 * Every restart-required config change funnels through the same handler:
 *
 *   - POST /v1/setup/network              — RPC URL change
 *   - POST /v1/setup/change-password      — keystore password rotation
 *   - POST /v1/setup/solvernets/:name     — SolverNet enable/disable
 *   - POST /v1/operator/join/:cid         — SolverNet join
 *
 * Headless gate: `JINN_NO_UI=1` (already the established headless flag in
 * main.ts) skips the respawn — operators running `jinn run --no-ui` from a
 * supervisor / systemd unit / docker entrypoint want the supervisor to
 * decide whether to restart, not the daemon.
 *
 * The helper is split out from main.ts so it's unit-testable without
 * touching the entry-point bootstrap path.
