/**
 * AI-units claim gate — issue #815.
 *
 * Pure decision function: given the credential's current 6h-block sum,
 * 7d-window sum, the projected debit for the next claim, and the
 * per-block / per-week caps, decide whether the claim may proceed. The
 * gate fails over to *proceed* when projection is unknown (paranoia: a
 * model gap must not silently halt a working daemon — log loudly,
 * keep claiming).
 *
 * Module-level memo tracks per-credential paused state keyed on
 * (credentialId, window, blockId) so the daemon emits exactly one
 * `ai_units_cap_reached` event + one warn log per pause edge, exactly
 * as the issue's acceptance contract requires. Block rollover (new
 * blockId) re-fires `newlyPaused` so the operator sees pauses in each
 * new 6h block instead of one silent indefinite mute.
