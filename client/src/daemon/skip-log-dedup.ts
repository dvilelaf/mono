/**
 * Dedupes "[daemon] skipping task X — reason" log lines so the engine-watcher
 * loop doesn't emit hundreds of identical lines per minute when a single in-flight
 * slot is occupied. The original loop logged once per `(taskId, reason)` per
 * pass; this helper collapses repeat lines down to one per `(taskId, reason)`
 * pair until the reason changes (or the entry is evicted to keep memory bounded).
 *
 * It additionally maintains a TTL-bounded *work-skip cache*: once `canAcceptTask`
 * rejects a task, the engine-watcher records the skip here and — for
 * `SKIP_RECHECK_TTL_MS` afterwards — fast-skips the task without re-running the
 * (expensive) `canAcceptTask` work at all. With a large backlog of
 * persistently-unacceptable tasks (e.g. ~40 evaluation tasks whose harness is
 * not enabled), re-running manifest resolution + schema validation +
 * `impl.isReady()` for every task every cycle blocks the Node event loop ~1-2s
 * and starves the HTTP API. The cache makes a repeat cycle a Map lookup.
 *
 * SAFETY: the TTL re-check is mandatory and bounded. A task is NEVER skip-cached
 * forever — once `SKIP_RECHECK_TTL_MS` has elapsed the cache reports the task as
 * due for re-check, so a task that becomes acceptable (operator enables the
 * harness, a slot frees up) is always picked up within the TTL.
 *
 * See jinn-mono-kzan (log dedup) and dogfood finding #14 (work-skip cache).
