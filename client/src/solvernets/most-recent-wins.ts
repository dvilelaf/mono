/**
 * Most-recent-wins resolver for SolverNet lifecycle events.
 *
 * Folds a stream of `IdentityRegistry.setMetadata` events with the
 * `solvernet-manifest:<cid>` key prefix into the current lifecycle status of
 * each unique (launcherAgentId, manifestCid) tuple.
 *
 * Per `spec/2026-05-05-solvernet-creation-and-launch.md` §6.3:
 *
 * > The most-recent-wins resolver picks the latest event per (agentId, cid)
 * > tuple. Lifecycle authenticity flows from `msg.sender == launcher's agent
 * > wallet` (enforced on-chain by IdentityRegistry's access control on
 * > `setMetadata`).
 *
 * Tiebreak rule: when two events share `blockNumber`, the one with the higher
 * `transactionIndex` wins (later in the block).
 *
 * Defensive: the resolver ignores any event whose `key` does not start with
 * `solvernet-manifest:`. The subgraph fetcher should already filter, but the
 * resolver does not trust upstream blindly.
 *
 * NOTE: this helper lives at `client/src/solvernets/most-recent-wins.ts` for
 * now. Spec §6.3 references `client/src/network-trust/most-recent-wins.ts`,
 * but `client/src/network-trust/` does not exist on this branch (it ships on
 * `opus/network-trust-v0`). When that branch merges, consolidate.
