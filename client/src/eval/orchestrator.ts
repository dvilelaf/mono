/**
 * `jinn eval` held-out checkpoint orchestrator (issue #818).
 *
 * Runs a held-out slate against a checkpoint in FROZEN mode, persists per-task
 * pass/fail, and emits a Wilson-CI resolved-rate comparison vs the parent
 * checkpoint. Every external boundary is constructor-injected — this is the
 * thin slice #819 drives a deterministic slate against with NO Docker/IPFS.
 *
 * Acceptance criteria:
 *   AC#1 — run the slate frozen, write per-task pass/fail.
 *   AC#2 — emit a resolved-rate comparison vs the parent with a CI.
 *   AC#3 — the freeze-fence holds: a `runHarnessOnce` `{ violation }` throws
 *          LOUD and the instance is NOT recorded (no implStateDir mutation
 *          slips through; enforcement lives in `runHarnessWithFreezeFence`).
 *
 * Per log/decisions/2026-05-28-rl-eval-measurement.md §4: v1-simple. Only large
 * deltas are trustworthy (disjoint Wilson intervals). No seed control, no
 * multi-run averaging.
