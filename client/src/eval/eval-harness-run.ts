/**
 * Daemon-faithful harness run for `jinn eval` (issue #818) and the #822 e2e.
 *
 * Live testing proved the eval's earlier hand-rolled harness invocation did NOT
 * reproduce the daemon's agent runtime: it ran the agent with NO SolverNet
 * runtime plugins, so the claude-code adapter passed no `--plugin-dir`, the
 * bundled MCP server never loaded, and the agent had no `submit_typed_payload`
 * tool — producing no gradeable patch and rendering every task unscorable. The
 * daemon scores the same tasks because it builds the full HarnessContext with
 * `solverPluginRoots` from the SolverNet's runtime plugins (engine.ts §runImpl).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that daemon-equivalent context.
 * It rebuilds the engine's HarnessContext MINUS persistence/on-chain wiring and
 * runs the harness through the SAME freeze-fence the daemon uses. The CLI uses
 * it now; the #822 e2e delegates to it next.
