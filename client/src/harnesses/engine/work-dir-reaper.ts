/**
 * Working-directory reaper.
 *
 * The TaskEngine provisions a per-task working directory under
 * `engine.workingDirRoot` (default `~/.jinn-client/engine/work/<requestId>/`).
 * Each one holds heavy scratch — a cloned repo, a per-task plugins copy, a
 * `system_snapshot.tar.gz`, session transcripts and an env directory.
 *
 * Historically nothing ever removed these. A long-lived operator accumulated
 * 412 work dirs / 49 GB with no cleanup (issue #320). The snapshot tarball is
 * uploaded to IPFS at delivery time, so once a task reaches a terminal state
 * (COMPLETE / FAILED) the on-disk working directory is pure dead weight.
 *
 * This module is the single place that decides what may be deleted. It is
 * deliberately conservative:
 *
 *   1. A directory whose requestId is currently in-flight is NEVER removed,
 *      regardless of age — the engine still needs it.
 *   2. A directory whose requestId is in a terminal state is removed
 *      immediately (its evidence already lives on-chain / on IPFS).
 *   3. A directory with no matching persistence row at all ("orphan" — left
 *      by a crash, an older daemon version, or a wiped DB) is removed only
 *      once it is older than `orphanMaxAgeMs`, so we never race a task the
 *      DB has not observed yet.
 *
 * It is pure I/O over the filesystem plus two caller-supplied id sets, which
 * makes it trivially testable and equally usable from the one-shot cleanup
 * script (`scripts/cleanup-engine-work.ts`).
