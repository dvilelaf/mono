/**
 * Env-gated stub harness for the T2.2 producer/evaluator gate.
 *
 * When JINN_HARNESS_STUB_INSTANCE is set, the canned patch at
 * <fixturesDir>/<instanceMatcher>.patch is returned as a SWE-rebench v2
 * restoration solution. Never calls an LLM; never accepts tasks whose
 * spec.instance_id differs from the configured matcher.
 *
 * PRODUCTION SAFETY — two-env-var requirement.
 * This is a *fake* harness: it produces canned, non-genuine work. If it ever
 * entered a real operator run it would generate fraudulent on-chain activity.
 * To make accidental activation impossible, the factory requires BOTH:
 *   JINN_HARNESS_STUB_INSTANCE     — instance ID this stub responds to
 *   JINN_TEST_MODE === '1'         — explicit test-mode sentinel
 * If JINN_HARNESS_STUB_INSTANCE is set but JINN_TEST_MODE is not '1', the
 * factory THROWS rather than silently registering the stub. A single stray
 * exported env var in an operator's shell can no longer activate it.
 *
 * Activated by environment variables:
 *   JINN_HARNESS_STUB_INSTANCE     — instance ID this stub responds to (required to activate)
 *   JINN_TEST_MODE                 — must equal '1' (defense-in-depth; required to activate)
 *   JINN_HARNESS_STUB_FIXTURES_DIR — dir containing <instanceMatcher>.patch files
 *                                    (default: client/test/release/tier-2/fixtures)
