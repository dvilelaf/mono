 * Construct the initial task prompt for the Hermes agent.
 *
 * The harness deliberately does NOT bake SolverNet-specific guidance into
 * this prompt. Per-SolverNet task patterns (repo setup, schema shape,
 * submission expectations) live in the SolverPlugin's SKILL.md files
 * (e.g. `swe-rebench-v2-runtime/skills/orient/SKILL.md` +
 * `plan/SKILL.md`). The harness loads those skills via
 * `solverPluginRoots` and the agent picks them up at runtime. Adding
 * SolverNet branching here would re-create the leak that retired the
 * earlier `sweRebenchV2Guidance()` helper — every new SolverNet would
 * require a code change in every harness's prompt builder.
