/**
 * Launcher mode status assembler.
 *
 * Composes per-SolverNet generator state, open-Task counts, and Safe budget
 * runway into the canonical `LauncherStatusResponse`. Surfaces every
 * SolverNet entry the daemon has loaded — launcher ownership is no longer
 * expressed via an operator-config `'launching'` role (Task 22 of
 * spec/2026-05-05-solvernet-creation-and-launch.md dropped that enum value);
 * the launched-record subsystem owns that signal now.
 *
 * Stale-poll detection is computed here when a generator reports a cadence:
 * a poll is stale when the wall clock has advanced past `lastPollAt + 2 *
 * cadenceMs`. Fill-the-pool generators may omit cadence and are never marked
 * stale by this generic status surface.
 *
 * The deps shape is intentionally narrow — every external surface is a
 * function so tests can inject deterministic state without standing up the
 * full daemon. Subdeps that require deeper integration (open-Task counts,
 * reserved-budget math, Safe-balance reads) are abstract here; v1 wires them
 * to placeholder accessors with TODO pointers at Task 7.

 *
 * NOTE (v1 edge case, jinn-mono-l2zl carry-over from Task 6 review): a
 * generator with a `cadenceMs > 0` and no `lastError` reports `active` even
 * before its first poll has completed. If the daemon has been running long
 * enough that the first poll *should* have completed but `lastPollAt` is
 * still undefined, the operator UI will show "active, not stale" — which is
 * misleading. The fix requires tracking a `genStartedAt` timestamp on the
 * generator so the gather function can compare `now - genStartedAt`
 * against `2 * cadenceMs`. Deferred to a follow-up: in v1 the prediction.v1
 * cadence is 6h, so the window between "started" and "first tick" is short
 * enough that the misclassification is rare in practice. Tracked under
 * the launcher-mode plan (spec/2026-05-05-launcher-role-and-mode.md §5.3).
